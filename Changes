Revision history for Perl extension Pod::Readme.

v0.999.0
        [Incompatabilities]
        - Major rewrite, using modern Perl 5.10 and Pod::Simple.

        - Changed how directives are handled, to abuse the POD spec
          less.

        - The "=for readme include" directive is no longer supported.

        [Other Changes]
        - Switched to semantic versioning.

        - Added MANIFEST.SKIP to distribution.

        - Recognise the =encoding directive, rather than dying when it's
          encountered.
          TODO: actually take heed of it.
          Thanks to Ivan Bessarabov for bringing this to my attention!

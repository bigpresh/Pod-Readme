This module filters POD to generate a F<README> file, by using POD
commands to specify which parts are included or excluded from the
F<README> file.

See the L<Pod::Readme> documentation for more details on the POD
syntax that this module recognizes.

See L<pod2readme> for command-line usage.

The original version was by Robert Rothenberg <rrwo@cpan.org> until
2010, when maintenance was taken over by David Precious
<davidp@preshweb.co.uk>.

In 2014, Robert Rothenberg rewrote the module to use filtering instead
of subclassing a POD parser.
